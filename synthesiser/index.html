					Between Septmeber 2021 and May 2025, I worked on an analogue, polyphonic, modular synthesiser.
					This means there are no digital circuits (analogue, with a minor excpetion), each part is an individual "module" that can be moved and replaced without affecting the others, and the result has the possibility to play multiple notes at the same time (polyphonic).
					For most of the modules, I mainly followed designs from a synth called the Digisound 80; the documents I used for this can be found <a href="http://www.digisound80.co.uk/digisound/default.htm">here</a>.
					The rest I took from various other sources, including designing a few myself. More information can be found on the <a href="./modules.html">Modules</a> page.
					<br/><br/>
					When realising that buying a synthesiser would cost a lot of money, I concluded that I would build one myself.
					My original inspiration for this was from a youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LOOKMUMNOCOMPUTER">LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER</a>.
					After visiting his <a href="https://this-museum-is-not-obsolete.com/">museum</a>, and using the Digisound 80 he has, I decided that this was the design I was going to use.
					<br/><br/>
					The image to the left is my full synth setup a few days after completion with a "simple" polyphonic patch. I know it seems like a lot of cables but trust me, the base circuit is actually quite simple.
					<br/><br/>
					There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9IQPXxPpM0">demo video</a> on youtube (shown on the left) of the synthesiser as it was in November 2023.
