					I made the decision to build the modules on stripboard instead of custom PCBs, but this has lead to the build process taking longer, and the modules construction to be a little sloppy.
					However I would not have got as far into construction if I had to find a company to print PCBS, and get them made. It would also have costed a lot more.
					<br/><br/>
					Nearly all modules have what is called voltage control, which means parameters in the module can be controlled by an external voltage input.
					This is very common of modular synthesisers and is a core part in how you use it and construct different sounds.
					<br/><br/>
					<s>The downloads contain both images and the original files.</s> I used <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a> for the schematics, and <a href="https://www.schaeffer-ag.de/fpd-doc/en/index.htm?fpd_welcome_frontpld.htm">Front Panel Designer</a> for the panel layouts.

						<p class="small">
							VCO stands for Voltage Controlled Oscillator.

							There is also Hard and Soft Sync, which allow for the cycle in the oscilation to be reset with an input pulse.
							<br/><br/>
							This design is mostly unchanged from the orignal, but some have a multiturn potentiometer for the pitch, and I tweaked how the PWM control functions slightly.

					<h2>VCF</h2>
					<div class="columns">
						<p class="small">
							VCF stands for Voltage Controlled Filter.
							There are 4 types of these in the synthesiser: Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, and Phase Shift.
							Low pass means that high frequencies are taken away, and low ones let through.
							High pass is the opposite. Band pass is a combination of both low pass and high pass, such that only a band of frequencies around the cutoff is let through, and everything else is taken away.
							Phase shift means that the effective phase of the oscillation sent through is changed.
							The phase shift can also be changed into a notch filter, which is the opposite of a band pass.
							<br/><br/>
							It has voltage control over both the cutoff frequency and resonance (feedback).
							I only made slight changes to this design, so mostly follows the original.
							The phase shift however has a few more modifications, adding the notch mode and a self oscillating mode.

							The reverb module is a spring reverb design by myself.
							Spring reverb is a reverberation enumation technique that uses coil driven springs to send the signal through.
							Pickup coils at the other end receive the reverberated signal, which is amplified and mixed with the original to control the amount of reverb.
							I deceided not to use the reverb design that the original Digisound 80 used, as the ICs would have been especially difficult to source, and I find that spring reverb sounds better that digital simuation.
							I used a few sources for inspiration and basic designs, including <a href="https://sound-au.com/articles/reverb.htm">this one by Rod Elliott</a>, <a href="sedrfg">and some others</a>.
